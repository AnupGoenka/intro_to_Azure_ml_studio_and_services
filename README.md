# Introduction to Microsoft Azure machine learning Studio and Services

## Questions you will answer in this workshop

## Learning Objectives

- Learn the difference between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep learning
- Learn how to perform machine learning without any code!
- See model training, tuning and deployment LIVE In the CLOUD!
- Learn the process of loading and preparing data for training
- Experiment with Azure ML Studio and Machine Learning Services

## What will I learn during this workshop

## Prequisites

While you won't need prior experience in practical machine learning or with Microsoft Azure to follow along with this class, we'll assume some familiarity with:

- Python programming language: See [Udacity - Intro to Python](https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110)

## Steps

This workshop consists of N activities:

## Flow

1. Clone this git repository using `git clone https://github.com/beginners-machine-learning-london/intro_to_Azure_ml_studio_and_services`
2. Create an Azure account

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: Make sure to shut down your Azure notebook instances and workspaces after you are done. Otherwise, you will get charged for it per hour. It will not shut down automatically. For training, you will provision a new instance, however that second instance will stop running after the training job is finished.

## Featured technologies

- [Python](https://www.python.org/): Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively.
- [Azure ML Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/): Azure Machine Learning Studio is a GUI-based integrated development environment for constructing and operationalizing Machine Learning workflow on Azure.

## Dataset Source

The dataset for this workshop can be obtained via UCI. However, a static copy is also provided in the `exercises/data` folder. You can download the dataset from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data))
